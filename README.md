[Tableau visualization of CitiBike data]( https://public.tableau.com/profile/marianne3066#!/vizhome/CitiBikeProject_16042940596120/JerseyCityCitiBikeAnalysis?publish=yes)

Using Python Pandas and Tableau, create an interactive dashboard analyzing Citi Bike useage statistics in Jersey City, 2016-October 2020.

## Data Cleaning
I used python pandas to import CSVs downloaded from https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data and clean the data. I found/replaced NAN values, removed outliers, and cleaned column headings in order to merge each CSV into one dataframe.

## Analysis
This dashboard includes the following dashboards and visualizations:
  1. A map illustrating the relationship between station location and popularity
  2. Analysis of activity by User Type
  3. Analysis of Users by Gender
  4. Analysis of the effects of COVID-19 on program useage.
